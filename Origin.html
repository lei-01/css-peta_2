    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>Hanan is a pre-colonial Filipino goddess from Visayan mythology. She is revered as the Goddess of Dawn and Morning, believed to prepare the way for the sun and guide it safely across the skies each day. Ancient communities honored Hanan through oral traditions, prayers, and rituals that treated sunrise as a sacred and meaningful moment. The coming of dawn was seen as her blessing, signaling protection, renewal, and the start of daily life. Hanan’s presence symbolized balance in nature, marking the gentle transition from darkness to light and reminding people of the importance of patience, hope, and harmony with the natural world. </p>

    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
     <p>I chose the myth of Hanan because it speaks to the quiet strength within all of us. Unlike gods of war, storms, or immense power, Hanan’s influence is soft but unwavering. She reminds me that beginnings do not have to be dramatic to matter—they can be gentle and still profoundly transformative. Her story teaches that even when darkness feels overwhelming, perseverance and calm resolve can restore balance. Dawn is not instant; it arrives gradually, and so too does change in our own lives. I find comfort in the idea that every day is a new opportunity, a second chance to act with hope and courage. Hanan’s story also deepens my appreciation for Filipino mythology, showing that our ancestors understood the importance of patience, optimism, and the natural cycles of life.</p>
